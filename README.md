Conducting a Security Audit
Subject: Security Program Assessment and Improvement Plan - Botium Toys

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our commitment to ensuring the utmost security for Botium Toys, I, Mark Zor, will be spearheading a comprehensive security program assessment and improvement initiative. The goal is to enhance our security posture by assessing existing assets and implementing controls and compliance best practices. Below is an outline of our approach:

Scope:
The scope of this assessment covers the entire security program at Botium Toys, encompassing all assets, internal processes, and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.

Goals:
Our primary objectives are to assess existing assets and complete a controls and compliance checklist. This will help us determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys' overall security posture.

Current Assets:
Assets managed by the IT Department include on-premises equipment, employee devices, storefront products, management systems, internet access, internal network, data retention and storage, and legacy systems.

Risk Assessment:
We have identified a significant risk due to inadequate management of assets and a lack of proper controls, potentially resulting in non-compliance with U.S. and international regulations. The risk score is currently 8 out of 10, indicating a fairly high level of risk.

Control Best Practices:
Our approach aligns with the first function of the NIST CSF - Identify. We will dedicate resources to identify and appropriately manage assets. Classification of existing assets and determining the impact of their loss on business continuity will be a priority.

Additional Comments:
We have identified specific areas that require attention:

Access controls and least privilege need implementation.
Encryption for confidential data, especially credit card information, is not currently in use.
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and disaster recovery plans are lacking.
Password policies and management systems need improvement.
Legacy systems monitoring and maintenance require a defined schedule.
Action Plan:

Immediate Measures:
Implement access controls and least privilege.
Initiate encryption for sensitive data, focusing on credit card information.
Begin the installation of an intrusion detection system.
Develop disaster recovery plans and initiate regular backups of critical data.

Short-Term Goals (1-3 Months):
Revise and enforce password policies in line with industry standards.
Implement a centralized password management system.
Define and implement a schedule for monitoring and maintaining legacy systems.

Long-Term Goals (3-6 Months):
Conduct a thorough review of privacy policies, procedures, and processes.
Evaluate and enhance physical security measures.
I encourage open communication and collaboration throughout this process. If you have any concerns or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your dedication to the security and success of Botium Toys.

Best regards,

Mark Zor
Future Cybersecurity Employee
